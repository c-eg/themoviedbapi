This library provides a java-wrapper around the [JSON API](http://api.themoviedb.org/) provided by
[TMdB](http://themoviedb.org), which is an open database for movie and film content.



Setup
-----

> **Starting with v1.15.1 the library has changed ownership. This required a change of the group-id from com.github.holgerbrandl to uk.co.conoregan**

It's available via [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/uk.co.conoregan/themoviedbapi). Just add it as dependency to your project.

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>uk.co.conoregan</groupId>
    <artifactId>themoviedbapi</artifactId>
    <version>1.15.1</version>
</dependency>
```
```
dependencies {
    implementation 'uk.co.conoregan:themoviedbapi:1.15.1'
}
```

Usage
-----

To get started you need a [TMdB API key](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/). With this you can instantiate
`info.movito.themoviedbapi.TmdbApi`, which has getters for all subcategories of the API.

For instance to get a movie by ID, do the following:

```
TmdbMovies movies = new TmdbApi("<apikey>").getMovies();
MovieDb movie = movies.getMovie(5353, "en");
```

The wrapper implements all major parts of the JSON API as detailed out in the [TMdB API documentation](http://api.themoviedb.org/).
However, as the latter is subject to constant change, feel welcome to point out missing bits by submitting a ticket.
Or even better, just send us a pull request!

Most common question: Why does `getSomething()` returns null?
---------------

Every API element has a number of query flags that need to be set in order to pull a particular piece of information.

#### Example 1: Make `getCast()` to return cast and not `null` 

```
TmdbMovies movies = tmdbApi.getMovies();
movies.getMovie(293660, "en", MovieMethod.credits)
```

#### Example 2: Get image urls, videos and similar movies
```
TmdbMovies movies = tmdbApi.getMovies();
movies.getMovie(78, "en", MovieMethod.credits, MovieMethod.images, MovieMethod.similar)
```


#### Example 3: Get all info about a sesaon
 
Instead of individual item we can also simply provide all method values.

```
TmdbTvSeasons tvSeasons = tmdb.getTvSeasons();
TvSeason result = tvSeasons.getSeason(seriesId, seasonNumber, "en", SeasonMethod.values());
```

See the corresponding `*Method` enums or the REST API-documentation for possible values.

This concept is part of the underlying [REST API](http://api.themoviedb.org/), our wrapper justs mimicks the scheme.



Project Logging
---------------

This project uses [SLF4J](http://www.slf4j.org) to abstract the logging in the project. To use the logging in your own
project you should add one of the provided [adapter bindings](http://www.slf4j.org/manual.html).

Prooguard / R8 rules
--------------------
Model classes are placed under `info.movito.themoviedbapi.model` package. Add this to `proguard-rules.pro` so that, these classes can survive minification.

```
-keep class info.movito.themoviedbapi.model.** { *; }
```

Notes & Acknowledgements
-------------------------

The library was developed for [Movito](http://www.movito.info) to interact with tmdb services. This library has been
inspired by [api-themoviedb](https://github.com/Omertron/api-themoviedb) but has been rewritten to provide a more open
license, a more clean API and to expose more features of the TMDB json api.

The library was created by [Holger Brandl](https://github.com/holgerbrandl) and was transferred to [Conor Egan](https://github.com/c-eg) on the 20th November 2023.
